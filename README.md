# Beer_Consumption_and_Attractiveness_to_Malaria_Mosquitos_-Simulation_and_Convergence-Analysis-

The purpose of this task is to respond several questions regarding a publication that found a relation between beer consumption and attractiveness to malaria mosquitos. More information about the study could be found in the followuing link: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009546  

The questions to be responded are:

1. Create side-by-side boxplots for the number of mosquitoes in each group (beer vs water)
2. Answer the question: What does the graph reveal about the data for both groups? Is there an association between beer consumption and attractiveness to mosquitoes?
3. Calculate basic statistics measures for each group: the mean, median, standard deviation and explain the numbers.
4. Write the code to implement the data simulation demonstrated in the video on the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dnw46eC-0o. Calculate the probability of obtaining the experiment outcome

Below you will find the step-by-step process to respond the questions
